            <hr>
            <p>We are a group of people who's hobbies are playing computer games. We all started way back on those old console like atari, family computer sega, etc. Together we decided to form a selling group of 2nd hand games. Although it is our hobbies but we are not collector. Majority of us once done with the game we don't play it anymore. Instead of collecting webs on the shelves we have decide to sell the games at an affordable prices this is to help gamers like us to play and owned games who can't afford to buy brand new one.</p>
            <p>On January 2023 Nicnoc Gaming Hub was formed to cater all gamers to own and play computer games at an affordable prices. Gamers can also register and re-sell there old games in this site. Together we can make our hobbies more affordable. Together we can attract more people to play games.</p>
            <p>We are truly a gamers place.</p>
